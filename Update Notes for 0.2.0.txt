Now you can use "setTimeMachine(Lite)" on Terminal to select the maximum number of snapshots you want to backup for TimeMachine(Lite)!

You can get the Deb package for TimeMachine on iOS from https://github.com/Halo-Michael/TimeMachine-on-iOS/releases  (That is not a repo)

Or get it on my repo https://halo-michael.github.io/repo
