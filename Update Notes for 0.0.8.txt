optimization:
Increase the distinction between iOS10 and iOS11
Now correctly keep seven snapshots created by TimeMachine on iOS on iOS10 instead of eight
The log output is now more detailed and solves the problem of using a snapUtil backup snapshot to cause no log output.
other:
Cydia plugin text description optimization
Now canceled support for iOS 11.4.1 and above (iOS12), after all, there are too many uncertainties in the future.

You can get the Deb package for TimeMachine on iOS from https://github.com/Halo-Michael/TimeMachine-on-iOS/  (That is not a repo)
