Snapshots that exceed the set limit are now automatically deleted (requires "setTimeMachine(Lite)" to be used to set TimeMachine again!)

You can get the Deb package for TimeMachine on iOS from https://github.com/Halo-Michael/TimeMachine-on-iOS/releases  (That is not a repo)

Or get it on my repo https://halo-michael.github.io/repo
