repair:
Renaming com.apple.TimeMachine.orig-fs/com.apple.TimeMachine.electra-prejailbreak back to orig-fs/electra-prejailbreak after uninstalling TimeMachine on iOS

Update:
Now you can use snapUtil to create snapshots instead of using snappy.
Now you can see how to use snapshots directly from Cydia.Please check 0.0.7.PNG.

You can get the compiled version of snapUtil from repo: http://okanon.github.io/cydia/ (thanks @cxx_flags for compiling snapUtil and providing it in his personal source)
You can get the compiled version of snappy from repo: http://repo.bingner.com/ (thanks to @sbingner for making and compiling snappy and providing it in his personal source)

You can get the Deb package for TimeMachine on iOS from https://github.com/Halo-Michael/TimeMachine-on-iOS/  (That is not a repo)
